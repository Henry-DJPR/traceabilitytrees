            The Traceability Planning Tool is a series of questions that, once
            completed, can provide helpful insights about the best traceability
            system for your business.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more information you input into the tool, the more effective it
            will be at helping you determine the next traceability steps to
            take.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tool will prompt you to think about what your traceability
            requirements are and how you can maximise benefits from your system
            and make business gains.
          </p>
          <p>
            It will also help you factor in other considerations such as the
            needs of your business partners, domestic regulations and
            international requirements.
